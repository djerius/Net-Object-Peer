  [API CHANGE]

    * The event emitted when a listener unsubscribes from an emitter
      is now named "unsubscribed" rather than "unsubscribe".
      it indicates a state, not a command to unsubscribe.

  [BEHAVIOR CHANGE]

    * Events which will be emitted *must* be registered, either via the
      default_events() class method, via the events attribute in the
      constructor, or via the events() object method.  Subscriptions
      will fail if the emitter does not produce the event, and
      attempts to emit an event will fail if the emitter does not
      produce the event.  The emits_events() method may be used
      to query an emitter for its events.

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * The prefix for event handler methods may now be specified either
      on a per object basis (via the event_handler_prefix) attribute,
      or on a per class basis via the default_event_handler_prefix
      class method.

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * New method: Peer::detach
    * Upon destruction, objects additionally emit a 'detach' event.
    * Net::Object::Peer::Subscriptions: new methods: find, nelem
    * Peer::subscriptions now takes arguments which are passed on to find
    * New role Peer::Ephemeral - instructs Peer to take a strong reference
      to the peer.

    * Most classes now track the reference address of an emitter in
      case the emitter has been proxied.  See the Cookbook for a usage.
