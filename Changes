  [API CHANGE]

    * the event emitted when a listener unsubscribes from an emitter
      is now named "unsubscribed" rather than "unsubscribe".
      it indicates a state, not a command to unsubscribe.

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * New method: Peer::detach
    * Upon destruction, objects additionally emit a 'detach' event.
    * Net::Object::Peer::Subscriptions: new methods: find, nelem
    * Peer::subscriptions now takes arguments which are passed on to find
    * New role Peer::Ephemeral - instructs Peer to take a strong reference
      to the peer.

    * Most classes now track the reference address of an emitter in
      case the emitter has been proxied.  See the Cookbook for a usage.
